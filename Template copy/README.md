## Instructions

You are given a string S of length N which encodes a non-negative number V in a binary form. Two types of operations may be performed on it to modify its value:

- if V is odd, subtract 1 from it;
- if V is even, divide it by 2.

These operations are performed until the value of V becomes 0.
For example, if string S = "011100", its value V initially is 28. The value of V would change as follows:
